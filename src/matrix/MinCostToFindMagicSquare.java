 * We define a magic square to be an  matrix of distinct positive integers from  to  where the sum of any row, column,
 * or diagonal of length  is always equal to the same number: the magic constant.
 *
 * You will be given a  matrix  of integers in the inclusive range .
 * We can convert any digit  to any other digit  in the range  at cost of .
 * Given , convert it into a magic square at minimal cost. Print this cost on a new line.
 *
 * Note: The resulting magic square must contain distinct integers in the inclusive range .
 *
 * For example, we start with the following matrix :
 *
 * 5 3 4
 * 1 5 8
 * 6 4 2
 * We can convert it to the following magic square:
 *
 * 8 3 4
 * 1 5 9
 * 6 7 2
